# Learning How to Learn

"The most effective, cutting-edge learning techniques that you can apply to your daily life." On this page we explain a little about the main problem with education. Later we explore different Learning techniques, some relative stats on learning and the brain, and the ten principles of rapid skill acquisition by Josh Kaufman. The page also features TED talks worthy of checking out. We highly recommend Salman Khans book "The One World Schoolhouse" with a link to purchase. If you're interested in more information on learning, we've provided some useful resources towards the bottom of the page.

Thank you for taking an interest in this program.
